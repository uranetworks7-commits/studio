## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3498db), to convey trust, stability, and a professional atmosphere, similar to established financial platforms.
- Background color: Dark gray (#34495e) to enhance the visibility of the graph and other UI elements, reducing eye strain during extended use. Also associated with high-end tech.
- Accent color: Bright green (#2ecc71) to indicate positive changes (gains), with a contrasting red (#e74c3c) to represent losses, making them easily distinguishable on the graph.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability and 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines for a modern tech feel. This gives the application a balance between professionalism and approachability.
- Use minimalist, clear icons for buy/sell actions and account information. Design should prioritize ease of use and intuitive understanding.
- Employ a clean, structured layout that focuses on the Bitcoin graph as the centerpiece. Place key information like balance and trading options within easy reach.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle animations for price updates and trading actions. The aim is to provide clear feedback to the user without being distracting.
